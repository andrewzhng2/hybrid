Hybrid is a personal training dashboard that lets multi-sport athletes log their weekly sessions, see which muscles each sport is hitting, and spot imbalances over time through simple visual analytics.

It resets every week from Sunday to Saturday, aggregates your activity history, and turns it into clear insights on how each sport contributes to a well-rounded athletic build.
